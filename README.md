# dmx-multiverse

Standard proposal

The goal: upgrade *de-facto* picture over the industry to extract more bandwidth from ready-made tonns of hadware.

Basic circuitry uses *MAX_485-like* ICs. 
The *time-slope-limited* versions of them are bound to DMX's 250 kbaud, thus allowing to forget many headaches using *ugly cheap almost-broken* cables.
Faster ICs are able to drive up to 10 Mbaud, 40 times faster tnan DMX does. Sure, this time cables can't be *almost-broken*, but *ugly cheap* ones still can do good.
